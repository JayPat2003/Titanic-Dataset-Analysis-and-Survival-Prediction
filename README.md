# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-and-Survival-Prediction

# Overview
This repository contains an analysis and machine learning project based on the famous Titanic dataset. The project aims to explore the dataset, gain insights into the demographics of the passengers, and predict whether a passenger survived or not using various machine learning algorithms.

The Titanic dataset is a classic and widely used dataset for data analysis and predictive modelling. It contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including features like age, gender, passenger class, ticket fare, and whether they survived or not.
